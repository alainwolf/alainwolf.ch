My [public keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) for
encryption, signing and authentication.

## OpenPGP

[OpenPGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy#OpenPGP) can be used
for encryption of mail messages and files. I'm using it to digitally sign email
messages, files and code commits.

Modern email client software, like
[Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/), will retrieve the public key
automatically,
[based on my email address](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=alain%40alainwolf.ch).

To ensure that a key actually belongs to a specific person, the fingerprint
should be checked. Ideally, this happens during a personal meeting.

On Android smartphones with the [OpenKeychain](https://www.openkeychain.org/)
app installed you can use the following QR-Code to add my public key into your
keyring:

## S/MIME Certificate

The following personal certificate can be used to send me encrypted
[S/MIME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S/MIME) mail messages and verify messages
or documents I have digitally signed with.

The [WISeID Identity Platform](https://wiseid.com/) has verified my name,
email-address, country and identity in an online process using my national ID
card. Certificates are then issued by
[WISeKeyâ€™s Certification Authorities](https://www.wisekey.com), which are
trusted by all web-browsers, mail clients and operating systems.

You can download the certificate and import it into your mail app or operating
system:

## SSH Public Key

I use my OpenPGP key to authenticate against
[SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) servers too.

If you already have verified and trust my OpenPGP key, you can also safely trust
my SSH key.

To allow me to access your systems trough SSH, you can export my OpenPGP key as
SSH key:

```bash
# My user ID on your system (change as needed)
$ _SSH_USER=wolf

# Search and install my OpenPGP key
$ gpg --search-keys 0x722389E427362DC5

# Export and install my SSH key
$ gpg --export-ssh-key 0x722389E427362DC5 \
    | sudo -u $_SSH_USER tee -a /home/${_SSH_USER}/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

On Ubuntu Linux systems you can get my public key from either
[Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/~awolf) or
[GitHub](https://github.com/alainwolf):

```bash
# Launchpad
ssh-import-id lp:awolf

# GitHub
ssh-import-id gh:alainwolf
```

Altenatively you can download my SSH public key:

## WireGuard VPN

For VPN connections with [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/), you can use
this WireGuard public key of my personal computer:

```text
[Peer]
PublicKey = VM37YPASrxm1x2BuAAx5ep+IiIKdlil2Y3q9jX8tQBM=
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0
PersistentKeepalive = 25
```
