You can manage and use OpenPGP keys on your Android smartphone with the
[OpenKeychain](https://www.openkeychain.org/) app.

It also allows other apps on your smartphone to use OpenPGP, for example use the
[K9 Mail](https://k9mail.app/) app to read and write encrypted mails.

You can scan the QR code below with the OpenKeychain app to add it into your
keyring:
